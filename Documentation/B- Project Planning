This section provides  information  regarding the  project  organization,  managerial  process, and technical  process.  It is the controlling section for managing this project and will be maintained and referenced in order to satisfy project requirements.

The main objective  for  the  development  of  the  The Cartoonify Images Software (CIS)  is to produce a low-cost, easy-to-use software to help convert images to cartoon-like images and sketches. 

The intended audience for this section is consists of: 
● The development team. 

In order for the software development to flow in an efficient manner, a software process model was selected to dictate  the  course  of development. A Waterfall approach will  be  used  to develop  the CIS.

Table 1 discuss the project functions and activities with the corresponding purpose or description  and  dates.  This  timeline  will  be  maintained  throughout  the duration  of  the  project. Additional project team meetings can be scheduled as needed.

As a time critical process, each team member will monitor the development schedule and report any setbacks to the project lead. The current  team progresses through  weekly  progress  reports,  and  there  will  be  weekly group discussions with the team members to monitor development and discuss any new criteria for the project. Microsoft Teams  will be the primary medium used to keep the members up to date in between group meetings.

The  work  package  pictured  below  in  Figure  2  is  divided into three functional sections: 

● Software Engineering This  section  encompasses  all  the  essential  engineering  research,  planning,  design  and required documentation. 

 ● Software Quality and Test This  section  involves  testing  and  validation  of  the  project  design  and  documenting  the development process 

 ● Software Implementation This section involves software integration and module programming needed for a successful project implementation. 


In the Software development phase, the following Processes will be performed:  

 Graphical User Interface process, consisting of the following activities: 
 - Design the layout of the main screen
 - Developing the upload and save button
 - Developing images convert panels 
 Software development, consisting of the following activities:
 - Select features needed
 - Display features to be solved
 - Create image conversion function.
 - Obtain feedback from the system if the function is wrong/ correct. 
Testing process, consisting of the following activities:
 - Testing the interface (GUI) of the app
 - Testing the process of image conversion
