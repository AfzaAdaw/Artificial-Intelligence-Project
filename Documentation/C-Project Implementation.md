# Project Implementation

## Deliverables:
Hardware Requirement: For the hardware, our team uses individual laptops which consists of intel core i7, i5 and 8GB RAM to conduct our project.

## Software Requirement:
For the software, our team uses Python programming language, openCV and easyGui modules to implement the code for converting real image into cartoon version.

## System Outcome:
There are total of 13 steps that will be applied in our system. However, among all of those steps only 4 steps which are considered as main steps which are converting the image into grayscale, smoothen the image and applied a blur effect, retrieving the edges of the image as well as masking the image to make it look like cartoon. The system is expected to show every image conversion preview so that user can see the differences between the original image and the cartoon image. The system supposed to allow user to choose which image preview that they want to save in their device.
