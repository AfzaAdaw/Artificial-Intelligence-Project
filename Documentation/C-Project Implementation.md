# Project Implementation

## Deliverables:
Hardware Requirement: For the hardware, our team uses the laptop which consists of intel core i7 and 8GB RAM to conduct our project.

## Software Requirement:
For the software, our team uses Python programming language, openCV and easyGui modules to implement the code for converting real image into cartoon version.

## System Outcome:
There are total of 13 steps that will be applied in our system. However, among all of those steps only 4 steps which are considered as main steps which are converting the image into grayscale, smoothen the image and applied a blur effect, retrieving the edges of the image as well as masking the image to make it look like cartoon.
