# CARTOONIFY IMAGES

## A. PROJECT SUMMARY

**Project Title:** Cartoonify image

**Team Members:** 
- Afza Adawiyah Bt Abdul Tahrim
- Nur Aisya Fatihah Bt Azhar
- Nur Syahirah Bt Mohd Izwan Wasandan
- Nur Afiqah Bt Halim


**Objectives:**
- Break out the project goal into more specific objectives: 
  - To convert a 3D image into a 2D image
  - To change an original image into a new version of image
  - To save time in converting multiple images to make animations


**Abstract**

Cartoon are wildly used in animations films. that it became a source of income and entertainment that is important to a community of people in the film industry and comic books adaptations. To produce an animation requires long hours to animate a scene full of backgrounds and plenty of character's movements, thus if the process to cartoonify a real camera-captured scenery into a cartoon image, should lessen half of the animation production.

## RESULT AND CONCLUSION
Cartoonify the image using OpenCV in real-time

You can launch the program using the following steps:
- Open Anaconda Navigator
- Choose JupyterNotebook
- Open CartoonifyImage.ipynb
- Click upload image button
- Choose the option desired either to save sketched or cartoonified image

## PROJECT PRESENTATION 
Through this project, we learned how to create a Cartoonify Image using OpenCV, changing images to grayscale, beautify and layering images in order to cartoonify it.

Other than that, we learned about Tkinter where we apply upload image, display image previews, save button and save image as. The support can read the image that we uploaded. 

Below, we include the video demonstration of Cartonify Image
