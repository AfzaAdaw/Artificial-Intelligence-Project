##  B. ABSTRACT 

Cartoon are wildly used in animations films. that it became a source of income and entertainment that is important to a community of people in the film industry and comic books adaptations. To produce an animation requires long hours to animate a scene full of backgrounds and plenty of character's movements, thus if the process to cartoonify a real camera-captured scenery into a cartoon image, should lessen half of the animation production.

In Figure 5, you can see that our face mask detector is capable of running in real-time (and is correct in its predictions as well.
